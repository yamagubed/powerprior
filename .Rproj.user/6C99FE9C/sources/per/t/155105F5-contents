Description: Implements conjugate power priors for efficient Bayesian analysis 
    of normal data. Power priors allow principled incorporation of historical 
    information while controlling the degree of borrowing through a discounting 
    parameter (Ibrahim and Chen (2000) <doi:10.1214/ss/1009212519>). This 
    package provides closed-form conjugate representations for both univariate 
    and multivariate normal data using Normal-Inverse-Chi-squared and 
    Normal-Inverse-Wishart distributions, eliminating the need for MCMC sampling. 
    The conjugate framework builds upon standard Bayesian methods described in 
    Gelman et al. (2013, ISBN:978-1439840955).
