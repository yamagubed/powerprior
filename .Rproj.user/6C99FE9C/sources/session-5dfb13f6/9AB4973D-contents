Description: Power priors provide a flexible framework for incorporating historical data
    in Bayesian analysis by discounting the historical likelihood with a power
    parameter. However, due to the complexity of the posterior distribution,
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is typically required to generate a
    representative sample for subsequent inferences. This becomes especially
    computationally intensive when the application needs repeated posterior
    sampling, such as Monte Carlo simulation studies. 'powerprior' is a package
    to implement conjugate representations of power priors for efficient 
    Bayesian analysis of normal data and to provide closed-form computation of power 
    priors and posterior distributions for both univariate (Normal-Inverse-Chi-squared)
    and multivariate (Normal-Inverse-Wishart) normal data.
